# MarkdownProjectManagement

The web application is intended to be used by corporate users that would like to manage records in a simple and easy to use UserInterface. The application has four core pieces of functionality that encompass CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), the user can interact with these features using a keyboard and mouse by creating a record or a project, the user will be presented with a form that has four text inputs for title, email, fullname and description, once filled out the user can then submit the form to which the data will be presented in a list view meaning the record is now captured in the mongodb database. The user can then update a single record one after the other, those values will be updated server and client side, and the user can also delete a record.
